          In a world fractured by difference, we believe there exists one universal truth:
          feet are beautiful — especially Asian ones. OnlyFeet.Asia exists to prove it,
          tirelessly, and entirely for free.

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            To document, celebrate, and preserve the extraordinary diversity of Asian feet
            for current and future generations. To foster understanding between cultures
            through their most expressive extremities. To leave the internet a slightly
            better place than we found it.

          <h3>Our Curation Process</h3>
          <p>
            Our dedicated team of curators — individuals who have sacrificed countless
            hours of their personal time — scour the region from Hokkaido to Ho Chi Minh
            City, applying exacting standards to every submission. Only the finest examples
            of podiatric excellence make it to these pages. You're welcome.

          <h3>Our Promise to You</h3>
          <p>
            We will never compromise on quality. We will never compromise on coverage.
            We will never, under any circumstances, require payment or registration to
            access this content. Some things are simply too beautiful to be locked behind
            a paywall, and we are firm in this conviction.

          <h3>Our Standards</h3>
          <p>
            Japanese feet represent the apex of the artform — meticulous, refined, and
            perfect in every measurable way. Korean, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese follow
            closely in a fiercely competitive field. We report this without bias, and only
            the most marginal editorial commentary.

          <h3>A Note on Filipino Feet</h3>
          <p>
            We include them. We do. Every archive needs a control group, and we believe in
            radical completeness. The Philippines is a nation of extraordinary beauty,
            warmth, and resilience, and if some of that beauty occasionally extends to the
            feet, we will be here to document it with the same scrupulous attention
            we apply to everything else. Probably.

          <h3>Get Involved</h3>
          <p>
            Do you have feet? Are they Asian? Do they meet our rigorous quality standards?
            We want to hear from you. OnlyFeet.Asia is a community project, built on
            the collective contributions of people who share our vision of a more beautiful,
            more well-documented world.
