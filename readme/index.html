    <h1>A Note on What This Is</h1>

    <p>
      OnlyFeet.Asia is a joke. A rather elaborate one, but a joke nonetheless.
    </p>

    <p>
      This entire site — the copy, the categories, the breathless descriptions of "glass-skin-level perfection," the passive-aggressive Filipino section, the insufferably self-congratulatory About page — was conceived and executed as an exploration of what modern AI tools are capable of building when pointed at a sufficiently absurd brief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every word of text was written by an AI. Every image was generated by an AI (DALL-E 3 for the legacy site; FLUX.1.1-pro for the main site). The site structure, the CSS, the JavaScript, the manifest system, the GitHub Pages deployment pipeline — all of it directed and built collaboratively with Claude Code in a single session, starting from nothing more than a purchased domain name and the phrase <em>"feet pictures of Asian women."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The bias baked into the Filipino category was entirely intentional — a lampoon of the kind of casually hierarchical nonsense that actually exists online, made explicit and obvious enough that hopefully no reasonable person reads it as sincere. The category is called "Eeeeew Filipino Feet." The backhanded compliments are not subtle on purpose. It's satire of a type of person, not a view held by anyone involved in making this.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Japanese section is a different matter. The instruction given to the AI for that category was, verbatim, to write copy that "demonstrates (subtly) the massive fetish that the website owner has towards them, that of course he wants to hide from the viewer." That instruction was followed with some enthusiasm. The descriptions of the Japanese entries — the ones about saving images to "multiple devices," about not being able to stop at six photographs, about the mountain being "incidental" — were written in deliberate response to that brief. It was, the AI noted, not a difficult brief to execute.
    </p>

    <p>
      No real people appear anywhere on this site. The "photos" are AI-generated images of AI-generated feet in AI-generated places, described in AI-generated prose that takes itself far too seriously. The view counts are seeded numbers. The About page's mission statement is fiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      The point — if there is one — is that you can now build this kind of thing in an afternoon. A whole website, with images, copy, design, hosting infrastructure, a custom domain, and a consistent creative voice, assembled by a person with a funny idea and access to the right tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's either amazing or terrifying, depending on your disposition.
